@shambolicgirl @caitoz I’ll have to read this instalment on the Ukraine- bribery, militias and the dirty war waged in the name of democracy. 

We get good guy - bad guy propaganda but the truth is all the more shocking. #ukrainerussiawar

Let’s join the hype. Others put an Ukrainian flag in their name.

I use a Russian flag. Come and hate me 👀🇷🇺 there is no way I will support the anti-Russia propaganda of the west. #UkraineRussiaWar


BREAKING:Russia annexes 4 Ukrainian regions partly occupied by Russian forces. Revisit a commentary by NBR senior fellow @RollandNadege following the Russian invasion of Crimea on what the Ukraine crisis meant for Asia: https://t.co/O057SCbFN0 #RussiaUkraineWar #UkraineRussiaWar


Based on how humanitarian convey has become a target for the Russians, Ukraine needs the means to supply equipment without endangering the lives of its people. I am confident that Draganfly with its drone technology will help. #Draganfly #Drones #UkraineRussiaWar #Charles #Karen https://t.co/yUOskVoW12

Overnight September 30, powerful explosions heard in the #Russian city of #Belgorod. The air defense system was activated in the city. ~Russian propaganda news agency RIA Novosti.#UkraineRussiaWar #Ukraine #UkraineWar #Russia https://t.co/NvCfHXRau2


The EU, the US, GB, Japan, in fact all of the countries sanctioning Russia because of their war in Ukraine, should sign into law that those sanctions will remain in place until all forcefully annexed regions of Ukraine return to Ukraine. #Ukraine #UkraineRussiaWar #Putin


Television news outlets in the Propaganda State have actually started a countdown clock for Putin's signing of the annexation of occupied territories.

RUS SM propaganda is pivoting to how "glorious" of a day it is today and Putin's "historic" speech on invading and illegally taking land from a sovereign country.
