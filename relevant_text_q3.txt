Based on how humanitarian convey has become a target for the Russians, Ukraine needs the means to supply equipment without endangering the lives of its people. I am confident that Draganfly with its drone technology will help. #Draganfly #Drones #UkraineRussiaWar #Charles #Karen https://t.co/yUOskVoW12
